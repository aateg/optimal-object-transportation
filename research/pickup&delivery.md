# Pickup-Delivery Problem

**Given the assumptions, which is the case that my problem match from the Survey in Pickup-Delivery?**

Multivehicle Pickup-Delivery Problem, constraint in section 2.3.2 and solution proposal in 3.2 in Survey.

**What are the next papers to read?**

the ones refered in next references



# Observations

- Dynamic case of the problem: **Demand Responsive Transportation Problem** Mageean and Nelson (2003) - Survey

- There is a distinction between static and dynamic PDP

- Section 3.2.4 might contain different applications that I can use

- Savelsbergh and Sol will generalize problem as PDP

- **ACHO QUE VALE A PENA IR DIRETO NAS REFERENCIAS DO SURVEY E PROCURAR COISA BOA POR LÁ**
