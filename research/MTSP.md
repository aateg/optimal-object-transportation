# Multiple Traveling Salesman Problem (MTSP)

MTSP is 
- More related to Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) and Task Assignment Problem (TAP).
- A relaxation of VRP with neither considering the vehicle capacity or customer demands.

$d(\text{MTSP}, \text{VRP}) \approx 0$

$d(\text{MTSP}, \text{VRP}) \leq d(\text{MTSP}, \text{TAP})$

Because it doens't allow  multiple visits or subtours.
