# Assumptions

All the cases are for Multivehicle Pickup Delivery Problem

## 1. Baseline

- Each drone can carry a single object
- All objects are equaly weighted
- Where are the drones located in the beginning?

# 2. Increased capacity of drones

- Drones can couple and therefore the problem allows objects 
with different weights, i.e., higher than what one drone can carry

# 3. Dynamic recofiguration

- Drones can couple and decouple in the in order to solve pickup-delivery
- This means that the number of vehicles changes with time
