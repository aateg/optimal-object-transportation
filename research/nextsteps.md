# Next Steps

[] Given the assumptions, which is the case that this problems match from the Survey in Pickup-Delivery?
[] Go deep into the papers refered for the problem case
[] Implement first the single vehicle case (Python)
[] Extend to the multivehicle case considering 1th assumptions
[] Leave the code good enough to be reusable and extendable (this might be necessary for the future)
