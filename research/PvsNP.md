# P vs. NP

This is the most popular question in computer science nowadays and probably will keep being for some time, here is why.

Have you ever heard about P vs. NP, is one of the Millenium Problems, which pays a million dollars for the solution for each problem, P vs. NP is one of them and is particularly fascinating.

From a historical perspective, John Nash, a famous mathematician introduced a new way of analysing ways of understanding solutions for problem, analysing input size of the problem versus time to compute de solution. This generates several interesting discussions regarding how to classify problems.

For example, if you plot the curve for summing two numbers, you will see something like the following:

IMAGE

You can easily notice that there is linear relation present in the curve. Classifying this problem as solvable in linear time.

Another possibility is to try to multiply two numbers, which relationship do you think it will contain? The answer is polynomial time.

ðŸ’¡ A polynomial is something that is from the form $ax^2 + bx + c$ EXPLAIN THIS BETTER

This classification implies that it possible to put each problem in sets, i.e., put the similar problems in different boxes
